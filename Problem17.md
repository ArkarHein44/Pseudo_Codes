### Problem 17:
Write an algorithm in pseudo code to accept the data from the keyboard and it into an array.

```{r, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
{Accept data and put it into an array}
Use Variables: n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, A:array[1..5] of integer
begin
	accept n1;
	A[1] <- n1;
	accept n2;
	A[2] <- n2;
	accept n3;
	A[3] <- n3;
	accept n4;
	A[4] <- n4;
	accept n5;
	A[5] <- n5;
end
```
