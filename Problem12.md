### Problem 12:
Write an algorithm in pseudo code to accept the integers before the number is -999 and find out how many number is accepted.
<br>
Note : This problem does not predefine the number of integers. Thus, we can not know the terminate value or repeated time. This means that we should not use for â€“loop. Assume that when you want to terminate this process, enter number -999.  

```{r, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
	{To accept the integer and count the number of integers}
	Use Variables: count, num;
	begin
		count <- 0;
		repeat
			accept num;
			count <- count + 1;
		until (num = -999)
		count <- count - 1;
		display "the count of integers is ", count;
	end
```
