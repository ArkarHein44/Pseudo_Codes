### Problem 5:
Write an algorithm in pseudo code that compute the average of three numbers.


```{r, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
{Calculate the average of three numbers}
Use Variables: num1, num2, num3, sum, avg;
begin
	accept num1;
	accept num2;
	accept num3;
	sum <- num1+num2+num3;
	avg <- sum/3;
	write avg;
end
```
